# 因果メカニズム

Gow et al. (2016) argue that, while causal inference is the goal of most accounting research, it is extremely difficult to find settings where straightforward application of statistical methods can produce credible estimates of causal effects (and the remaining chapters of this part arguably support this claim). Does this mean accounting researchers must give up making causal statements? Gow et al. (2016) argue that the answer is “no” and suggest an increased focus on causal mechanisms as one path forward.

In this chapter, we aim to help the reader understand the idea of causal mechanisms, which can suggest empirical analyses that do not rely on, say, random assignment to treatment, which is very rarely found in accounting research. Unlike the other chapters in this part, this chapter is largely qualitative and contains no empirical analysis.

Accounting research is not alone in its reliance on observational data with the goal of drawing causal inferences. For this reason, it is natural to look to other fields using observational data to identify causal mechanisms and ultimately to draw causal inferences. Epidemiology and medicine are two fields that are often singled out in this regard. In the next two sections, we briefly provide examples and highlight the features of the examples that enhanced the credibility of the inferences drawn.1 A key implication of this discussion is that accounting researchers need to identify clearly and rigorously the causal mechanism that is producing their results.

<!-- ## 18.1 John Snow and cholera -->
## 18.1 ジョン・スノーとコレラ

<!-- A widely cited case of successful causal inference is John Snow’s work on cholera.  -->
成功した因果推論の広く引用される例として、ジョン・スノーによるコレラに関する研究がある。
<!-- As there are many excellent accounts of Snow’s work, we will focus on the barest details.  -->
スノーの研究に関する多くの優れた説明があるため、ここでは最も基本的な詳細に焦点を当てる。
<!-- As discussed in Freedman (2009, p.339), “John Snow was a physician in Victorian London.  -->
Freedman (2009, p.339)によると、「ジョン・スノーは、ビクトリア朝のロンドンの医師であった。
<!-- In 1854, he demonstrated that cholera was an infectious disease, which could be prevented by cleaning up the water supply.  -->
1854年、彼はコレラが感染症であり、水道を清掃することで予防できることを証明した。
<!-- The demonstration took advantage of a natural experiment.  -->
この実証は自然実験を利用して行われた。
<!-- A large area of London was served by two water companies.  -->
ロンドンの広い地域は2つの水道会社によって供給されていた。
<!-- The Southwark and Vauxhall company distributed contaminated water, and households served by it had a death rate ‘between eight and nine times as great as in the houses supplied by the Lambeth company,’ which supplied relatively pure water.”  -->
サザーク・ヴォークホール社は汚染された水を供給しており、その水を供給された家庭の死亡率は「ラムベス社が供給する比較的純粋な水を供給する家屋の死亡率の8〜9倍」となっていた。
<!-- But there was much more to Snow’s work than the use of a convenient natural experiment.  -->
しかし、スノーの研究には、便利な自然実験の利用以上のものがあった。
<!-- First, Snow’s reasoning (much of which was surely done before “the arduous task of data collection” began) was about the mechanism through which cholera spread.  -->
まず、スノーの推論（おそらく「データ収集の困難な作業」が始まる前に行われたものの大部分）は、コレラがどのようにして広がるかというメカニズムについてであった。
<!-- Existing theory suggested “odors generated by decaying organic material.”  -->
既存の理論では、「腐敗した有機物によって生成される臭気」とされていた。
<!-- Snow reasoned qualitatively that such a mechanism was implausible.  -->
スノーは、そのようなメカニズムは不合理であると質的に推論した。
<!-- Instead, drawing on his medical knowledge and the facts at hand, Snow conjectured that “a living organism enters the body, as a contaminant of water or food, multiplies in the body, and creates the symptoms of the disease.  -->
代わりに、医学的知識と手元の事実に基づいて、スノーは「生物が体内に侵入し、水や食物の汚染物質として、体内で増殖し、病気の症状を引き起こす」と推測した。
<!-- Many copies of the organism are expelled with the dejecta, contaminate water or food, then infect other victims” (Freedman, 2009, p. 342). -->
その生物の多くのコピーが排泄物とともに排出され、水や食物を汚染し、それによって他の宿主を感染させる。

With a hypothesis at hand, Snow then needed to collect data to prove it. His data collection involved a house-to-house survey in the area surrounding the Broad Street pump operated by Southwark and Vauxhall.
As part of his data collection, Snow needed to account for anomalous cases (such as the brewery workers who drank beer, not water).
It is important to note that such qualitative reasoning and diligent data collection were critical elements in establishing (to a modern reader) the “as if” random nature of the treatment assignment mechanism provided by the Broad Street pump.
Snow’s deliberate methods contrast with a shortcut approach, which would have been to argue that in his data he had a natural experiment.

Another important feature of this example is that widespread acceptance of Snow’s hypothesis did not occur until compelling evidence of the precise causal mechanism was provided. “However, widespread acceptance was achieved only when Robert Koch isolated the causal agent (Vibrio cholerae, a comma-shaped bacillus) during the Indian epidemic of 1883” (Freedman, 2009, p. 342). Only once persuasive evidence of a plausible mechanism was provided (i.e., direct observation of micro-organisms now known to cause the disease) did Snow’s ideas become widely accepted.

We expect the same might be true in the accounting discipline if researchers carefully articulate the assumed causal mechanism for their observations. It is, of course, necessary for researchers to show that a proposed mechanism is consistent with observed behaviour in the institutional setting being examined. As discussed below, detailed descriptive studies of institutional phenomena provide an important part of the information used to evaluate a proposed mechanism.
